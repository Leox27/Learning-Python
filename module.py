      Becoming The Hokage Doesn't Mean People Will Acknowledge You. 
      But When The People Acknowledge You, 
      You Can Become Hokage. Never Forget Your Friends!

      Look at me! There’s nothing in my heart, 
      I don’t feel pain any longer. 
      There’s no need to feel guilty, Kakashi. 
      This hole was opened up by this world of hell… Kakashi, it’s okay now. 
      You don’t need to suffer anymore… Wish for whatever you want. 
      Anything is possible in this genjutsu world. 
      That hole in your heart can be filled immediately.
      - Obito Uchiha

      YOU AND I
      SIMPLE ARRIVED ON DIFFERENT CONCLUSION
      LET ME CLARIFY THIS BEFORE WE FIGHT
      I WILL TEACH YOU EXACTLY
      WHAT BEING HOKAGE 
      MEANS TO ME NOW
      -Sasuke Uchiha
